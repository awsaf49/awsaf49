### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Awsaf. I'm a **Data Science** and **Deep Learning** enthusiast. Though currently I'm studying **Electrical and Electronics Engineering**, I'm passionate about Data Science and Deep Learning. I've also contributed to real life reaserach works where I've been able to apply the knowledge of Deep Learning mostly on Medical Images(X-ray, MRI, CT Scan). Two of my works already have been publshed. I also love put my knowledge of Deep Learning onto the test while participating **Data Science comeptition** where I get to use Deep Learning in a competitive environment(**Kaggle, Data Driven, Grand Challenge** etc). I'm also very fond of **Signal Processing** where I can really get to know how Deep Learning models works under the hood. I really love to work a challenging problem, make my hand dirty by coding and do analysis afterwards.
Whenever I'm free I would like spend my time for myself and my family because at the end of the day I'm a human being.
