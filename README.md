### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Awsaf. I'm a data science and deep learning enthusiast. Though currently I'm studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I'm passionate about Data Science and Deep Learning. I've also contributed to real life reaserach works where I've been able to apply the knowledge of Deep Learning mostly on Medical Images(X-ray, MRI, CT Scan). Two of my works already have been publshed. I also love put my knowledge of Deep Learning onto the test while participating Data Science comeptition where I get to use Deep Learning in a competitive environment(Kaggle, Data Driven, Grand Challenge etc). I'm also very fond of Signal Processing where I can really how Deep Learning models works under the hood. 
I really love to work a challenging problem, make my hand dirty by coding and do analysis afterwards. Whenver I'm free I would like spend my time for myself and my family because at the end of the day I'm a human being.
